      <p>We are The Propane Store. We can fulfill all your propane needs!</p>

      <p>We can fill any size tank, the 20 Lbs for grills, 5 or 10 Lbs for boats or small grills, to 100 Lbs for industrial uses like roof work or for food trucks, Forklifts, to RV tanks, and anything in between! </p>

      <p>Most tank exchanges only give you 15 Lbs of propane in a 20Lb tank. Refilling here gives you the full 20Lb capacity that makes your tanks run longer!</p> 

      <p>Not only do we fill tanks-  we are one of the only places around that can recertify tanks that are more than 12 years old. Tanks that are out of certification are not allowed to be legally filled. The recertification takes less than 10 minutes and last for 5 years.* If you take good care of your tanks the recertification is certainly cheaper than buying a new tank. </p>   
      </div>
    <div class="split-text-right">
      <p>We even offer lower rates for larger, industrial tanks, such as on forklifts or 100Lb tanks and can even fill mobile homes. </p>

      <p>We also can get hose fittings. For grills, blowtorches, RVs & mobile homes, anything else you need made up for you, repairing or replacing with  higher quality material than usually found in chain stores, which will last you longer and give you more flexibility in usage. Most fittings can be made within 20 minutes if we have the parts.  </p>

      <p>Additionally we sell any other parts you need: regulators, pig/hogtails, valves for tanks, you name it.</p>

      <p>If we need parts special ordered, as long as we put the order in before 3 P. M. we can have them around 11 A. M. the next day. If not then it'll be the day after that.</p>

      <p>*possibly less in cases of excessive rust, damage to the tank, etc. </p>
